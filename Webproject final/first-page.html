                            <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language.
                                It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software
                                Foundation.
                                It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers
                                to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.
                                Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more
                                efficiently.

                                few implementation dependencies as possible.

                                Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine.
                                The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.
